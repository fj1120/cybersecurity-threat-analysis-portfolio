# Phishing Attack Analysis Using Splunk

## Objective
To analyse security logs in Splunk to identify indicators of a phishing-based attack and understand attacker behaviour.

## Analysis Process
- Queried authentication and email-related logs in Splunk
- Identified suspicious login attempts and abnormal activity patterns
- Correlated events across multiple log sources

## Findings
- Multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful authentication
- Indicators consistent with credential harvesting techniques

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- T1566 – Phishing
- T1078 – Valid Accounts
- T1110 – Brute Force

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how log correlation and framework-based analysis can support early detection of phishing-related incidents.
