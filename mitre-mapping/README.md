# MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

This section documents how observed attacker behaviours from log analysis were mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## Purpose
- Translate raw security events into recognised adversary techniques
- Understand attacker intent and attack progression
- Support structured reporting and detection improvement

## Example Mapping Approach
- Identify suspicious behaviour from logs
- Determine the tactic (e.g. Initial Access, Persistence)
- Map to the relevant ATT&CK technique and sub-technique
- Validate mapping against ATT&CK descriptions

## Techniques Covered (Examples)
- T1566 – Phishing
- T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter
- T1053 – Scheduled Task / Job
- T1071 – Application Layer Protocol

## Outcome
- Improved visibility of attack chains
- Clear linkage between log evidence and ATT&CK techniques
- Stronger alignment with industry-standard threat modelling
