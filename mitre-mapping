# MITRE ATT&CK Attack Chain Mapping

This document maps observed attacker behaviours to the MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand tactics, techniques, and potential impact.

## Attack Chain Overview
1. Initial Access – Phishing (T1566)
2. Credential Access – Brute Force (T1110)
3. Persistence – Valid Accounts (T1078)

## Purpose
Mapping attack behaviour to MITRE ATT&CK helps standardise analysis and improve detection and response planning.
