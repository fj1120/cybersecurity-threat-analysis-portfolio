# Cybersecurity Threat Analysis Portfolio

This repository showcases practical cybersecurity threat detection, incident analysis, and risk assessment work, 
focusing on real-world attacker techniques, detection logic, and governance considerations.

The portfolio is designed to demonstrate hands-on analytical capability aligned with SOC operations, 
cybersecurity consulting, and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) roles.

---

## 📌 Project Scope

This portfolio includes:
- Detection engineering using Splunk SPL
- Incident analysis and analyst reasoning
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
- Governance and risk assessment of attacker behaviour
- Clear documentation suitable for technical and non-technical stakeholders

All examples use redacted or simulated data for academic and portfolio purposes.
